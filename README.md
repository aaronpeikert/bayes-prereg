# Why does preregistration increase the persuasiveness of evidence? A Bayesian rationalization.

Preregistration is becoming increasingly popular in the psychological
sciences. At the same time, many researchers struggle to make precise
predictions and feel overwhelmed by the need to prespecify every detail
of their analysis plan. Should they surrender and discard the idea of
preregistration altogether? Not at all. We argue for the benefits of
preregistration beyond strictly confirmatory studies. Grounded in
Bayesian reasoning, we define a formal objective for preregistration
that neither declares changes to a preregistration to be sinful nor
punishes rigour. This objective rests on the relevance of “theoretical
risk”, a generalization of type-I error rate, for judging the evidential
support for theories. We propose that preregistration should aim to
reduce the uncertainty in judging the theoretical risk instead of
directly limiting the type-I error rate. We argue that this
reformulation extends the utility of preregistration, provides
principled justification for preregistration and is more closely aligned
with researchers’ intuition. If we do not know how the researchers
arrived at their evidence, we have great uncertainty about the
theoretical risk they took, which severely limits the utility of the
researchers’ evidence. Preregistration effectively reduces this
uncertainty and therefore generates more persuasive evidence.
