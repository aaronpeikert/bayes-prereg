As a response to the reproducibility crisis, preregistration is becoming increasingly popular in the psychological sciences to explicitly separate prediction from postdiction.
At the same time, many researchers struggle to translate their theories into precise predictions and may feel overwhelmed by the need to prespecify every tiny detail of their analysis plan.
Should they surrender and discard the idea of preregistration altogether?
Not at all.
We argue for the utility of preregistration for all types of studies, even beyond purely confirmatory studies.
From a perspective of Bayesian philosophy of science, we define a formal objective for preregistration that neither declares post hoc changes to a preregistration to be sinful nor punishes rigor.
This objective rests on the relevance of “theoretical risk” [@meehlTheoreticalRisksTabular1978], which is a generalization of the type-I error rate, for judging the evidential support for theories.
A common view is that preregistration is supposed to limit the type-I error rate by committing to a specific data analysis plan before data are collected.
In our view, the purpose of preregistration is to reduce the uncertainty in judging the theoretical risk of a given study. 
We argue that this perspective provides a principled justification for preregistration, extends its utility, and is more closely aligned with researchers' intuitions about evidential support.
The more we know about how researchers arrived at their findings, the smaller our uncertainty about the theoretical risk they accepted, and the more persuasive the researchers' evidence is.
Preregistrations can effectively reduce uncertainty about theoretical risk, which increases the persuasiveness of evidence, and hence they are warranted for any empirical study.
