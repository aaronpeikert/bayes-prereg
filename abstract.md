Many researchers increasingly distrust results in the published literature and turn to preregistration as a remedy.
At the same time, they struggle with the demand to translate their theories into precise predictions and the need to prespecify every minute detail of their analysis plan.
Should they surrender and discard the idea of preregistration altogether?
Not at all.
We explicate an objective for preregistration to help researchers guide their decisions about what to preregister, in what detail, and when to deviate in the face of unforeseen challenges and opportunities.
This objective rests on the relevance of “theoretical risk” [@meehlTheoreticalRisksTabular1978], which is a generalization of the type-I error rate, for judging the evidential support for theories.
A common view is that preregistration is supposed to limit the type-I error rate by committing to a specific data analysis plan before data are collected.
In our view, the purpose of preregistration is transparency.
More specifically transparency about the theoretical risk of a given study.
These objectives partially overlap, but we argue that the latter can be justified from first principles, extends the utility of preregistration, and is more closely aligned with researchers' intuitions about evidential support.
Crucially, transparency is a goal that is attainable for any empirical study, even those that are exploratory.
The more we know about how researchers arrived at their findings, the smaller our uncertainty about the theoretical risk they accepted, and the more persuasive the researchers' evidence is.
Preregistrations can effectively reduce uncertainty about theoretical risk, which increases the persuasiveness of evidence, and hence they are warranted for any empirical study.
